THE ENVIRONMENT WE ARE WORKING ON:
- We implemented our program in Java using Intellij IDE CE (Version 2018.1.2).
- We utilized Junit 5 for our unit tests. You may be prompted to import Junit 5 into your system if you see that the test
  classes are highlighted in red indicating an error. 
- Our program works best on Macs I believe. One member who was not a Mac user couldn't get the .txt files from our write
  to file functions to show up.  All Mac users had no issues. However, another member tested it on another non-Mac system
  and it was working fine. It might just be issues with the particular computer and not with Windows as a whole.

THE STEPS YOU NEED TO RUN THE PROGRAM LOCALLY:
- Compile and run the java class "ChocAn." It is our main.
