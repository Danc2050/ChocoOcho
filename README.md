THE ENVIRONMENT WE ARE WORKING ON:
- We implemented our program in Java using Intellij IDE CE (Version 2018.1.2), and utilized Junit 5 for our unit tests.
- Our program works best on Macs I believe. One member who was not a Mac user couldn't get the .txt files from our write
  to file functions to show up. However, when another member tested it on his other laptop that was not a Mac, it was
  working fine, so it might just be issues with the other member's computer and not with Windows. All Mac users had no issues.

THE STEPS YOU NEED TO RUN THE PROGRAM LOCALLY:
- Compile and run the java class "ChocAn." It is our main.
